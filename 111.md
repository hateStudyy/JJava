Self-recommendation Letter
Dear Sir or Madam,

Thank you for reviewing my application. As a Software Engineering student at Beijing Institute of Technology, Zhuhai (BITZH), I have a solid academic foundation in Data Structures, Algorithms, and Spring Boot development, with my GPA ranking in the top 30% of the department.

A key project experience is developing a Smart Dormitory Management System using Spring Boot and MySQL, where I designed backend logic for facility scheduling, user authentication, and real-time data visualization. This project honed my skills in RESTful API design and database optimization. Beyond academics, I served as tech support lead for "Coding for Seniors," organizing workshops to teach programming basics, and helped coordinate campus hackathons as a Developer Student Club member, strengthening my teamwork and project management abilities.

Eager to apply my Spring Boot expertise and problem-solving skills in a professional setting, I believe my technical background and hands-on experience align well with the demands of your team.

Sincerely,
[Your Name]
